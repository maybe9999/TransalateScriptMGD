<h1> Translator MGD</h1>

<h2> Negative points: </h2>
- It takes approximately 12 hours to translate all of X Events. (Needs optimization)
- There are certain dialogues that due to errors in the code or translation errors, not everything is translated and remains as it was originally.

<h2> Solutions</h2>
- Instead of translating dialogue by dialogue, you can translate groups of dialogues (It would greatly optimize the time required), I will implement it later 

- A script to analyze dialogs that remain the same between the translated file and the original. if a == b: print("Translation error"), Those specific parts would be translated.
